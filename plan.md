TODO:
- Get Render detection working. Ideally get all repos from a reasonable time frame i.e. created within the last 6 months
- Potentially sequence runs to avoid rate limiting
- Set up CRON job to run once a day
- General code cleanup
- Switch from PAT to new GitHub App and get back to Trey on specifics
- Render READMEs or remove
- Realign on metrics scoring to emphasize freshness
- Smooth out UI design
- Update documentation, add to each dir
