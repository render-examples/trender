TODO:
- Get Render detection working. Ideally get all repos from a reasonable time frame i.e. created within the last 6 months
    - Currently only picking up repos from internal Render orgs. Change this by eliminating Render topics filtering
- Decide whether to render READMEs better (without images/tags) or remove entirely
- Set up CRON job to run once a day
    - Decide how to best include new data in database. Should we rewrite on every run?
- General code cleanup
- Switch from PAT to new GitHub App and get back to Trey on specifics
- Smooth out UI design
- Update documentation, add a folder README to each dir
